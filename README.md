üå∏ 1. Iris Clustering

File: Iris_Clustering.ipynb

Objective:
To explore and cluster the famous Iris flower dataset based on its sepal and petal measurements using unsupervised learning techniques.

Key Steps:

Load and clean the Iris dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships between features.

Apply clustering algorithms:

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

Visualize clusters using scatter plots and dendrograms.

Evaluate performance using silhouette scores.

Compare the clustering output with the actual species to assess accuracy.

Main Insight:
K-Means provided clearer cluster separation and higher silhouette scores, making it more suitable for this dataset.

üåç 2. Urban Air Pollution Challenge

File: urban_air_pollution.ipynb

Objective:
To analyze and cluster global air pollution data to identify pollution patterns and compare against a leaderboard score.

Key Steps:

Data preprocessing and cleaning of pollutant measurements.

Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering.

Use Random Forest as a baseline model for classification or ranking.

Evaluate performance based on a public leaderboard.

Results:

Leaderboard rank: 372 out of 1582 participants.

The model revealed patterns in pollutant magnitudes and meteorological variables, highlighting distinct pollution zones.

Reflection:
Although done solo, the project demonstrated effective use of clustering and model evaluation. Future work could include feature engineering and advanced ensemble methods to improve ranking.
